# PupPals
Final Thesis Project
Making connections is never the easiest task for humans to do, they are not as good at it as their dog counterparts. Humans naturally have less of a tendency to approach another human and engage in conversation, let alone engage in conversation that would prompt another human to suggest a future interaction between their pets. PupPals looks to simplify this interaction by connecting humans (users of this application) for the sole purpose of having a puppy playdate, someone to look after their pet or simply for any reasonable purpose involving their pets. The solution to this interaction issue is within the web application I have created, PupPals. 

PupPals is a simple interafce to use, comprised of one webpage to handle everything. 
  The index.html page contains 
    - Create Account 
    - Login / Sign out
    - Home 
    - Update Account 
    - Query Selectors 
    - Returned users 
 
 Users who have created an account then then start to search for other users by eneter four fields 
    - Breed
    - Size
    - Age
    - Location (State) 
    
 This will then return any users in the database who match all four of those conditions.
